creating my own version of machine learning coursera homework 1
the data 'exdata1.txt' and 'exdata2.txt' are taken from the homework 1 source.


still need to understandd
- vectorized grad descent
- optional task
- the ex1.m program thorughly
- observe why it could be "theta = gradientDescent(X, y, theta, alpha, iterations);" in ex1.m, vectorized?
